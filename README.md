# Phase 3 Requirements
1. ~~Ensure all routes are working correctly and return an error message object if they need to fail~~
2. ~~Display any error messages to the user if they occur~~
3. ~~Update your account settings to allow a profile picture. Store the picture directly in the database, resized to no bigger than 512x512 (keeping in mind our CSS can scale down easily), as base64 encoded text.~~
4. ~~Design all pages on your site using Google Jamboards or some other mockup tool.~~
5. ~~Pick a CSS framework. Use either Bootstrap or Tailwind~~
6. Create a cohesive, responsive (meaning it responds to size changes and looks good on all screen types), theme for your site.
7. ~~Every page in your site must have:~~
   * ~~A header~~
   * ~~A menu~~
   * ~~A message area that will be used to display error messages should they occur~~
   * ~~A main content area~~
   * ~~A footer with copyright information~~
8. You should use your chosen CSS framework for most of the design work. You may add your own CSS (and should), but let the framework carry the load.
9. ~~CSS should be applied to any "major" element, forms, images, sections, articles, buttons, etc.~~
10. All spelling and grammar is correct. Feel free to run it through Grammarly or other AI assistant.
11. ~~You use Pug or some other templating engine~~
